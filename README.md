# Raytracer
This project doesnÂ´t use any framework. It has integrated an object reader and recreates the physics of the lights. The objects that are going to be displayed can have some materials that affect the way light behaves on them; these effects are reflection and refraction. The program makes a 2d image as an output, like a picture of the scene.
